Check out the project spec for the detail of each project.

## proj1:
Implemented the buffer overflow attack, string format attack, and an attack that bypasses the address space layout randomization.

## proj2:
Built a more secure version of Dropbox assuming the database and the network are malicious. We designed a cryptographic protocol where users can edit, store, share, and un-share     files between multiple users without impersonation, data leakage, or loss of information.  

## proj3:
We were given a web application and we had to design attacks such as SQL injection and XSS attack.
